Hi! I am a 5th-year PhD student at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I work on decision-making under uncertainty with a particular interest in its efficient computation. I am interested in applications in supply chains, mobility, and safe ML. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Peter Zhang.
